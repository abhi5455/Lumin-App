### Bridging the Gap Between Campus & Career

**Placement preparation shouldn't be a guessing game.**

In many colleges, students navigate placement season with incomplete data. They struggle to know which companies recruit consistently, what roles are available, or where alumni typically land. **Lumin** eliminates this uncertainty by centralizing placement data into one actionable mobile platform.
